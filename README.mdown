# connect-coffee

A [connect](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/) plugin that allows CoffeeScript to be compiled and served as JavaScript.

## Usage

    npm install connect-coffee

Then when creating your Connect (or Express) server instance, give the `connect-coffee` function a directory and pass the result to the `createServer` function. Here's an example that uses `connect-coffee` in conjunction with the popular `staticProvider` module:

    connectCoffee = require 'connect-coffee'
    
    app = connect.createServer(
        connect.staticProvider(__dirname + '/public'),
        connectCoffee(__dirname + '/public')
      )
    
    app.listen 3000

In this example, calling `http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico` will serve the file `public/favicon.ico`, and calling `http://localhost:3000/myScript.js` will compile `public/myScript.coffee` and serve the result (unless `myScript.js` already exists).

## TODO

This is an early release, and I'm no expert on the intricacies of the Connect framework. So please, head over to the [Issues](http://github.com/TrevorBurnham/connect-coffee) page and raise someâ€”or better yet, fork this project and make some pull requests!

Known stuff-that-should-be-done:

* Fine-grained control over cache expiration
* Better compilation error handling (growl notifications?)
* Concatenation/minification
